# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vince, a full-stack developer, full time since 2018, with a university degree in software development and IT engineering. Don't ask why I spent four years in universityâ€”the best justification I have is that it gave me more time to tinker before stepping into the industry. Yet, like everyone with a similar experience, I learned more in the first six months of my first job than in those four years of university.

I enough to do some cool stuff) about:

* JS/TS
* React
* HTML Canvas
* HTML/CSS
* Docker
* Rest API/OpenAPI
* Java
* Python/Django
* Learning new things really fast
* Vim/Neovim
* And a bunch more things...

I'm a jack of all threads, master of none, but I work with enough different technologies to avoid getting bllsh*tted by magical tech hype while picking up new skills quickly.
